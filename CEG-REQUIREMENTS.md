# CEG — Community Emergency Guide

## What CEG Is

A mobile-first, public-facing emergency dashboard for the Topanga/Malibu/Calabasas region. Zero login required. Three decisions, no cognitive overload. Connects to BRASS for IC zone leaders and enables LE reunification safely.

**URL:** `ceg.sfg.ac`
**Stack:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)

### PHASE 2: Full Check-In System

**Expand `/checkin` with richer data capture:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **7 Check-In Statuses** | SAFE, EVACUATING, AT_MUSTER, SHELTERING_HERE, NEED_HELP, NEED_MEDICAL, LOOKING_FOR_SOMEONE |

- `incident_qr_tokens` — QR code auth tokens

---

### PHASE 3: EMS Complaint Triage

**Route:** `/ems` (new page)
**Philosophy:** "The system triages. The patient just describes."

**Two-step flow:**
1. **Your Info** — Name, phone (for medic callback), party size, GPS location
2. **What's Wrong?** — Pick from 13 complaint types (user never sees tier labels)

**13 Complaint Categories:**

| Complaint | Icon | Tier | Auto-Action |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| Chest Pain / Pressure | 💔 | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Difficulty Breathing | 😮‍💨 | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Someone Is Unresponsive | 🚨 | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Heavy Bleeding / Won't Stop | 🩸 | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Severe Allergic Reaction | ⚠️ | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Diabetic Emergency | 🍬 | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Burns | 🔥 | 1-CRITICAL | Auto-dial 911 |
| Asthma — Have Inhaler | 🌬️ | 2-MINOR | Dispatch callback queue |
| Twisted Ankle / Can't Walk | 🦶 | 2-MINOR | Dispatch callback queue |
| Need Medication Refill | 💊 | 2-MINOR | Dispatch callback queue |
| Anxiety / Panic | 😰 | 2-MINOR | Dispatch callback queue |
| Cut or Scrape | 🩹 | 2-MINOR | Dispatch callback queue |
| Something Else | 📋 | 2-MINOR | Free text + callback |

**Confirmation screens:**
- **Tier 1:** Pulsing phone animation → "CALLING 911 NOW" → CERT card for offline handoff
- **Tier 2:** "YOU'RE CHECKED IN" → "A medic or dispatcher may call you"

---

### PHASE 4: Shelter-in-Place Pin

**Route:** `/shelter` (new page)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| GPS pin | Auto-capture current location |
| Manual address | Fallback if GPS unavailable |
| Party size | 1, 2, 3, 4+ buttons |
| Mobility indicator | "Can move" or "Limited mobility" |
| Notes field | Optional message to responders |
| Status | Sends `SHELTERING_HERE` to check-in API |

---

### PHASE 5: Reunification Portal

**Route:** `/reunification` (expand existing API into full page)

**Three-Layer Privacy Model:**

| Layer | Who | What They See |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| **Public** | Anyone | FOUND_SAFE / FOUND_HELP / NOT_FOUND (zero PII) |
| **IC/Zone Leader** | Authenticated IC | Zone totals, help queues, household flags, search patterns |
| **LE Reunification** | Law enforcement | Full PII for active cases, missing person cross-ref |

**Public flow:**
1. Enter phone number of person you're looking for
2. Phone is hashed client-side before submission
3. Returns one of 3 fixed messages (never raw data)
4. Rate limited: 5 lookups/minute per IP
5. All lookups audited for pattern detection

**IC/LE Dashboard (served from BRASS, not CEG):**
- `ic_reunification_data()` RPC — 100 most recent lookups, repeat-search patterns, NOT_FOUND cross-reference
- Identifies anxious family (repeat searches) and potential missing persons (NOT_FOUND patterns)

---

### PHASE 6: Household Pre-Planning

**Route:** `/household` (new page)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Member Registration** | Adults, children, elderly, special needs |
| **AFN Flags** | Additional Functional Needs (medical, mobility, sensory) |
| **Pet Inventory** | Dogs, cats, horses, birds, other with counts |
| **Go-Bag Checklist** | Auto-generated based on household composition |
| **Emergency Vault** | Document storage (insurance, medical records, photos) |
| **Grab Locations** | Where important items are stored in the house |

**Smart checklist generation:**
- Medical needs → medication list, equipment
- Children → age-appropriate supplies
- Pets → carriers, food, vaccination records
- Mobility equipment → wheelchair, walker, oxygen
- Priority tiers: essentials → important → nice-to-have

---

### PHASE 7: Stuck/Evacuation Assistance

**Expand "Stuck / Can't Evacuate" into detailed form:**

| Field | Options |
|-------|---------|
| Reason | Traffic 🚗, Road blocked 🚧, No vehicle 🚫, Mobility limitation ♿, Other 📍 |
| Location | GPS + manual address |
| Vehicle description | Make, color, license plate (optional) |
| People count | How many people with you |
| Notes | Additional details for responders |
| Status | Sends `NEED_HELP` or `EVAC_ASSISTANCE_NEEDED` |

---

## BRASS Integration: Operator Roles (RBAC)

Three tiers of access to CEG data from the BRASS side:

### zone_lead (Operational Counts)
- Scoped to assigned zones only
- `GET /api/brass/zones/my-summary` — Zone counts (no PII)
- `GET /api/brass/zones/feed` — Check-in feed without names/phones
- Sees: occupancy, help count, medical count, capacity %

### ic_ops (Incident Commander — All Zones)
- Full zone access, household-level flags
- `GET /api/brass/ops/all-zones` — All zone summaries
- `GET /api/brass/ops/household-flags` — Household codes + expected vs accounted + AFN flags
- `GET /api/brass/ops/household/:code` — Names + roles (no contact info)

### le_reunification (Law Enforcement — Full PII)
- Full PII access for active reunification
- `GET /api/brass/reunification/lookup?phoneHash=` — Full records with contact
- `GET /api/brass/reunification/household/:code` — Full household PII
- `GET /api/brass/reunification/missing-crossref` — NOT_FOUND → missing person leads
- Audit-logged, time-scoped to active incidents only

---

## Security & Privacy

| Layer | Enforcement |
|-------|------------|
| Phone hashing | Raw phone numbers never stored — SHA-256 hash only |
| RLS (Row Level Security) | Database enforces role-based access at query level |
| Public = INSERT-only | Anon key cannot SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE |
| Rate limiting | 5 lookups/min per IP on reunification |
| Audit trail | All reunification lookups logged with IP + timestamp |
| JWT auth | BRASS operators use 8-hour HS256 tokens |
| PII isolation | Only `le_reunification` role can access contact info |

---

## Event Model

All submissions create immutable events:

```typescript
{
  eventId: string;        // UUID
  incidentId: string;     // "DEFAULT" or specific incident
  timestamp: number;      // ms epoch
  method: "QR_WEB" | "LORA_PASS" | "MANUAL";
  confidence: "VERIFIED" | "LIKELY" | "MEDIUM" | "UNKNOWN";
  subject: {
    subjectType: "PHONE_SUBMISSION" | "DEVICE";
    submissionId: string;
  };
}
```

**Event types:**
- `EVAC_CHECKIN` — Status check-in (7 statuses)
- `EMS_REQUEST` — Medical complaint (13 types, auto-tiered)
- `EVAC_ASSISTANCE_NEEDED` — Stuck/can't evacuate
- `SHELTER_IN_PLACE` — Location pin with party info

Phase 3 ✅  EMS complaint triage (17 types, auto-911, tier-based routing)
Phase 4 ✅  Shelter-in-place pin page (mobility + notes)
Phase 5 ✅  Reunification portal page (rate-limit feedback)
Phase 6 ✅  Household pre-planning + go-bag (localStorage-only)
Phase 7 ✅  Stuck/evacuation assistance form (people count, vehicle, mobility)
```

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Dependent details → Phase 6, not Phase 2** | Emergency check-in (Phase 2) must be fast — 3 taps max. Detailed household composition belongs in pre-planning (Phase 6) when users aren't panicking. |
| **Emergency vault deferred** | Document storage requires authentication and cloud storage. MVP uses localStorage-only for the household page. Vault will come when auth is added. |
| **Phase 6 MVP = localStorage-only** | Zero-login requirement means no server-side storage. All household data persists in the browser. Users can print their go-bag checklist. |
| **BURNS + ALLERGIC promoted to Tier 1** | Per spec: burns are critical, allergic reactions risk anaphylaxis. Both require 911 routing. |
| **4 new complaint codes added** | DIABETIC (T1), ASTHMA (T2), ANXIETY (T2), MEDICATION (T2) — brings help page to 17 complaints matching EMS page coverage. |
